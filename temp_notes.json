Basically, \"WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/8980/pfx ./nine-install.sh\" on the extracted folder. To check if it installed correctly, I changed directory to bin64, since the prefix is 64-bit (although the game itself seems 32-bit -- dx9 and all) and did \"WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/8980/pfx wine ./ninewinecfg.exe.so\". This opens a little GUI that confirmed I had all the necessary files ready to go. The game was started with parameters GALLIUM_HUD=fps %command% just for initial benchmarks. I changed WillowGame.ini just a tiny bit, following some recommendations from youtube channel LowSpecGamer. The main changes I remember were detailMode from 2 to 1 (not 0, like LowSpecGamer) and turning VSync on. With Vsync on, I get a really smooth 30fps+no tearing experience that I didn't have with wined3d. I can turn every single graphics setting high at 1600x900 except Depth of Field. This and Dynamic Shadows are the heaviest settings, but even my APU+Gallium9 were able to tank them at smooth framerate. If the mileage varies, I could definitely tune down some other settings. Being 30fps instead of 60 doesn't bother too much, but I won't try Vsync off right now (or further lowering things until I get a constant 60 with this poor game's optimization).

Disable Esync (if not, you'll get <1 fps in game and in menu) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Change your primary display to 1024x768 (temporarily): `xrandr --output YOUR_PRIMARY_DISPLAY --mode 1024x768`. By default, it will try to run in 1024x768, and if your screen's resolution is higher, you'll only see the top-left corner of the screen.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 3. Run the game once\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 4. Go to the Video Settings and change the \"primary adapter\" to \"windowed\" (temporarily). Currently, the only options should be \"windowed\" and \"1024x768\".\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 5. Quit the game\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 6. Set your primary display's resolution back to it's native res: `xrandr --output YOUR_PRIMARY_DISPLAY --auto`\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 7. Start the game again.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 8. Go back to the video settings. The \"primary adapter\" dropdown should now list all the modes available for your display. Select your native resolution (2560x1440 was listed for my display and works great). Note: when I tried keeping it on \"windowed\", the in-game hud was too small for the screen.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 9.

If you've messed with Transformation Matrix values in libinput or xinput to increase mouse sensitivity, then you'll have a spinning screen as soon as you capture the mouse and try to look around.\n\nA solution:\n1. Open the terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and type: xinput list\nNote the ID number your mouse has. Mine has id=11, and that's what I'm using in this example. *You will have to use your own id number*\n\n2.

Next, type the command: \nxinput set-prop 11 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n4. Run the game and enjoy. Once you're done, run the above command and set the numbers in Coordinate Transformation Matrix back to the default.\n\nMods works fine, unless they use an executable to install themselves.

You can use \"-interline\" as a launch option, or you can manually change a WINE setting so it will emulate a virtual desktop at 640x480. Using \"-interline\" as a launch option will put ugly horizontal black bars all over the screen, making the game darker and UNdebatably decreasing the picture quality. (Injecting black bars into pretty much any picture will make it look worse. There is no debate here.) The upside is you get to run the game fullscreen, and that's the only advantage to using \"-interline\". The second option, the virtual desktop method, gives better picture quality but you'll be running it in a 640x480 window. I think the virtual desktop method works better because there's a 30fps cap on Oddessy and Exoddus anyways, so that combined with the blackbars makes fullscreen look like crap. To emulate a virtual desktop, open a terminal and type \"WINEPREFIX=\"/your/path/to/your/SteamApps/compatdata/15700/pfx/\" winecfg\" all one command, without the outside quotes, but keep the inside if you have any spaces in your path. For example: WINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/.steam/SteamApps/compatdata/15700/pfx\" winecfg. In the new window, switch over to the graphics tab, put a checkmark in the box next to \"emulate a virtual desktop\" and change 800x600 to 640x480. Then click apply and ok, and run the game. From there, it will run perfectly. Note: If you increase the size of the virtual desktop, AbeWin.exe will automatically resize it back down to 640x480, so a larger virtual desktop won't help you. In addition to that, if you click the mouse while using a larger resolution, AbeWin.exe will crash and you will have to kill it manually. So you still need to set the virtual desktop resolution to 640x480. Outside of that, it runs perfectly. :)", "word_count": 147, "char_count": 1806, "sentence_count": 18, "avg_word_length": 5.925170068027211, "lexical_diversity": 0.6802721088435374, "tokens": "get running easily using two different methods use launch option manually change wine setting emulate virtual desktop using launch option put ugly horizontal black bars screen making game darker undebatably decreasing picture quality injecting black bars pretty much picture make look worse debate upside get run game fullscreen advantage using second option virtual desktop method gives better picture quality running window think virtual desktop method works better cap oddessy exoddus anyways combined blackbars makes fullscreen look like crap emulate virtual desktop open terminal type winecfg one command without outside quotes keep inside spaces path example winecfg new window switch graphics tab put checkmark box next emulate virtual desktop change click apply ok run game run perfectly note increase size virtual desktop automatically resize back larger virtual desktop wo help addition click mouse using larger resolution crash kill manually still need set virtual desktop resolution outside runs perfectly", "stemmed_tokens": "get run easili use two differ method use launch option manual chang wine set emul virtual desktop use launch option put ugli horizont black bar screen make game darker undebat decreas pictur qualiti inject black bar pretti much pictur make look wors debat upsid get run game fullscreen advantag use second option virtual desktop method give better pictur qualiti run window think virtual desktop method work better cap oddessi exoddu anyway combin blackbar make fullscreen look like crap emul virtual desktop open termin type winecfg one command without outsid quot keep insid space path exampl winecfg new window switch graphic tab put checkmark box next emul virtual desktop chang click appli ok run game run perfectli note increas size virtual desktop automat resiz back larger virtual desktop wo help addit click mous use larger resolut crash kill manual still need set virtual desktop resolut outsid run perfectli", "lemmatized_tokens": "get running easily using two different method use launch option manually change wine setting emulate virtual desktop using launch option put ugly horizontal black bar screen making game darker undebatably decreasing picture quality injecting black bar pretty much picture make look worse debate upside get run game fullscreen advantage using second option virtual desktop method give better picture quality running window think virtual desktop method work better cap oddessy exoddus anyways combined blackbars make fullscreen look like crap emulate virtual desktop open terminal type winecfg one command without outside quote keep inside space path example winecfg new window switch graphic tab put checkmark box next emulate virtual desktop change click apply ok run game run perfectly note increase size virtual desktop automatically resize back larger virtual desktop wo help addition click mouse using larger resolution crash kill manually still need set virtual desktop resolution outside run perfectly", "noun_count": 60, "verb_count": 17, "adjective_count": 29, "adverb_count": 11, "entities": "[]", "sentiment": "positive", "compound_score": 0.9262, "positive_score": 0.111, "negative_score": 0.069, "neutral_score": 0.82, "topic_category": "performance, bugs, compatibility"}, {"note_text": "use \"-interline\" (without comets)", "word_count": 3, "char_count": 33, "sentence_count": 1, "avg_word_length": 5.333333333333333, "lexical_diversity": 1.0, "tokens": "use without comets", "stemmed_tokens": "use without comet", "lemmatized_tokens": "use without comet", "noun_count": 2, "verb_count": 0, "adjective_count": 0, "adverb_count": 0, "entities": "[]", "sentiment": "neutral", "compound_score": 0.0, "positive_score": 0.0, "negative_score": 0.0, "neutral_score": 1.0, "topic_category": "other"}, {"note_text": "works with the launch option -interline", "word_count": 3, "char_count": 39, "sentence_count": 1, "avg_word_length": 5.666666666666667, "lexical_diversity": 1.0, "tokens": "works launch option", "stemmed_tokens": "work launch option", "lemmatized_tokens": "work launch option", "noun_count": 3, "verb_count": 0, "adjective_count": 0, "adverb_count": 0, "entities": "[]", "sentiment": "neutral", "compound_score": 0.0, "positive_score": 0.0, "negative_score": 0.0, "neutral_score": 1.0, "topic_category": "compatibility"}, {"note_text": "The launch option \"-interline\" solve the cutscene problem.

The only solution I couldn't test, because it didn't install, was installing WMP9 via protontricks/winetricks. Presumably, installing WMP9 would have also installed the proper codecs. But this couldn't be done, as Proton seems to only use win64 prefixes and WMP9 can only be installed on a win32 prefix, as there isn't a 64 bit version of WMP9. So I'm throwing in the towel on this one. I hope someone in the future can get something useful from this information.

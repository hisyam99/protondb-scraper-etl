The game crashes seemingly randomly with an identical error after some time, only during transitions between campaign parts. Italicized text in subtitles is distorted and only barely legible. 

After some time playing, and after multiple identical crashes, I couldn't get the game to crash again. I'm leaving it bronze, because I feel that these crashes aren't something that'll resolve themselves if you let the game die a few times. I didn't remember to take a screenshot to show the message here until it stopped happening.

"Cutscenes stutter but the rest of the game seems to work fine but to get it running you will first need to do a lot of steps: 

1.) If it isn't installed already install Wine.
2.) You will also need to create a new Steam library as the game for some reason doesn't start if it's installed in ""~/.local/share/steam"".
3.) Install the game, start it in Steam and exit it by pressing ALT+F4 when the main menu appears (don't be afraid of the malformed window. It will be fixed after all steps are done).
4.) Open a terminal and configure the game's wineprefix with ""WINEPREFIX=~/[steam library in which you installed the game]/steamapps/compatdata/6200/pfx winecfg"" without quotation marks.
5.) In winecfg go to graphics, uncheck the two ""Allow the window manager""-options, check ""Emulate a virtual desktop"", set desktop size to your standard desktop-resolution (in my case 1920x1080), click Apply and click Ok.
4.)Start the game in Steam (The game will now appear in a window which might appear on the other monitor if you are using a 2nd monitor in Expand-mode. To get the game to run in fullscreen-mode on your main-monitor follow the next steps).
5.) In the game's main menu start a new game.
6.) When you are on the world-map showing the ""Ghoul Room"" and ""Haunting 101"" press ESC and click Exit Game.
7.) Back in the main menu click on Options->Display and set the resolution to 1600x1200 then click Accept and then exit the game with the exit-button in the main menu.
8.)Inside Steam rightclick on the game in your Library, select properties and click on ""Browse Local Files"".
9.) Go to GhostData and Open SpDrv.cfg with a text-editor (f.e. gedit).
10.) In the ""MinW""- and ""MaxW""-columns change all numbers to the width of your standard desktop-resolution (in my case 1920) and in the ""MinH""- and ""MaxH""-columns to the height of your standard desktop-resolution (in my case 1080) and save the file.
11.) Now start the game again in Steam and it should now start in fullscreen-mode and normally run on your main-monitor.",156,2021,29,5.371794871794871,0.6153846153846154,cutscenes stutter rest game seems work fine get running first need lot steps installed already install wine also need create new steam library game reason start installed install game start steam exit pressing main menu appears afraid malformed window fixed steps done open terminal configure game wineprefix steam library installed game winecfg without quotation marks winecfg go graphics uncheck two allow window manager check emulate virtual desktop set desktop size standard case click apply click ok start game steam game appear window might appear monitor using monitor get game run follow next steps game main menu start new game showing ghoul room haunting press esc click exit game back main menu click display set resolution click accept exit game main menu inside steam rightclick game library select properties click browse local files go ghostdata open gedit minw maxw change numbers width standard case minh maxh height standard case save file start game steam start normally run,cutscen stutter rest game seem work fine get run first need lot step instal alreadi instal wine also need creat new steam librari game reason start instal instal game start steam exit press main menu appear afraid malform window fix step done open termin configur game wineprefix steam librari instal game winecfg without quotat mark winecfg go graphic uncheck two allow window manag check emul virtual desktop set desktop size standard case click appli click ok start game steam game appear window might appear monitor use monitor get game run follow next step game main menu start new game show ghoul room haunt press esc click exit game back main menu click display set resolut click accept exit game main menu insid steam rightclick game librari select properti click brows local file go ghostdata open gedit minw maxw chang number width standard case minh maxh height standard case save file start game steam start normal run,cutscenes stutter rest game seems work fine get running first need lot step installed already install wine also need create new steam library game reason start installed install game start steam exit pressing main menu appears afraid malformed window fixed step done open terminal configure game wineprefix steam library installed game winecfg without quotation mark winecfg go graphic uncheck two allow window manager check emulate virtual desktop set desktop size standard case click apply click ok start game steam game appear window might appear monitor using monitor get game run follow next step game main menu start new game showing ghoul room haunting press esc click exit game back main menu click display set resolution click accept exit game main menu inside steam rightclick game library select property click browse local file go ghostdata open gedit minw maxw change number width standard case minh maxh height standard case save file start game steam start normally run,76,20,32,6,[],positive,0.9267,0.05,0.012,0.938,"performance, compatibility"

"After starting the game, I noticed that the video is offset towards the bottom so that the bottom ~10% of the game cannot be seen.

Issues are freezes in gameplay for accessing certain menues (like 15 second wait time until you get to the hacking screen).

You have to open a lot of these bugged menues during gameplay, so this is the point, that brings the game down to bronze from me.

Second issue are that the high-res versions of some textures (like certain posters or NPC-bodies) fail to load, even if you are standing close to them (and yeah, the age of the game and graphic engine is accounted for - I know the game from windows). So far, there was one (non-critical) section, where this was a real issue: I needed to read a door-code on a piece of paper, that was just a mash of pixels. Impossible without help from the internet.

"The game runs okay-ish with the default wined3d implementation, but I noticed it seemed way smoother after trying Gallium Nine. I went to the GN standalone repository (https://github.com/iXit/wine-nine-standalone) tried release 0.2 and followed the instructions. Basically, ""WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/8980/pfx ./nine-install.sh"" on the extracted folder. To check if it installed correctly, I changed directory to bin64, since the prefix is 64-bit (although the game itself seems 32-bit -- dx9 and all) and did ""WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/8980/pfx wine ./ninewinecfg.exe.so"". This opens a little GUI that confirmed I had all the necessary files ready to go. The game was started with parameters GALLIUM_HUD=fps %command% just for initial benchmarks. I changed WillowGame.ini just a tiny bit, following some recommendations from youtube channel LowSpecGamer. The main changes I remember were detailMode from 2 to 1 (not 0, like LowSpecGamer) and turning VSync on. With Vsync on, I get a really smooth 30fps+no tearing experience that I didn't have with wined3d. I can turn every single graphics setting high at 1600x900 except Depth of Field. This and Dynamic Shadows are the heaviest settings, but even my APU+Gallium9 were able to tank them at smooth framerate. If the mileage varies, I could definitely tune down some other settings. Being 30fps instead of 60 doesn't bother too much, but I won't try Vsync off right now (or further lowering things until I get a constant 60 with this poor game's optimization). I HIGHLY recommend going to Borderlands Wiki and doing some camera tweaks, like changing Field of View to 16:9 screens (110 or so angle).",121,1691,14,6.43801652892562,0.9008264462809917,game runs default implementation noticed seemed way smoother trying gallium nine went gn standalone repository https tried release followed instructions basically extracted folder check installed correctly changed directory since prefix although game seems wine opens little gui confirmed necessary files ready go game started parameters command initial benchmarks changed tiny bit following recommendations youtube channel lowspecgamer main changes remember detailmode like lowspecgamer turning vsync vsync get really smooth tearing experience turn every single graphics setting high except depth field dynamic shadows heaviest settings even able tank smooth framerate mileage varies could definitely tune settings instead bother much wo try vsync right lowering things get constant poor game optimization highly recommend going borderlands wiki camera tweaks like changing field view screens angle,game run default implement notic seem way smoother tri gallium nine went gn standalon repositori http tri releas follow instruct basic extract folder check instal correctli chang directori sinc prefix although game seem wine open littl gui confirm necessari file readi go game start paramet command initi benchmark chang tini bit follow recommend youtub channel lowspecgam main chang rememb detailmod like lowspecgam turn vsync vsync get realli smooth tear experi turn everi singl graphic set high except depth field dynam shadow heaviest set even abl tank smooth framer mileag vari could definit tune set instead bother much wo tri vsync right lower thing get constant poor game optim highli recommend go borderland wiki camera tweak like chang field view screen angl,game run default implementation noticed seemed way smoother trying gallium nine went gn standalone repository http tried release followed instruction basically extracted folder check installed correctly changed directory since prefix although game seems wine open little gui confirmed necessary file ready go game started parameter command initial benchmark changed tiny bit following recommendation youtube channel lowspecgamer main change remember detailmode like lowspecgamer turning vsync vsync get really smooth tearing experience turn every single graphic setting high except depth field dynamic shadow heaviest setting even able tank smooth framerate mileage varies could definitely tune setting instead bother much wo try vsync right lowering thing get constant poor game optimization highly recommend going borderland wiki camera tweak like changing field view screen angle,46,19,22,9,[],positive,0.9662,0.108,0.029,0.864,"performance, compatibility"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR: you really only need to setup the video settings and you're good to go.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. Disable Esync (if not, you'll get <1 fps in game and in menu) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Change your primary display to 1024x768 (temporarily): `xrandr --output YOUR_PRIMARY_DISPLAY --mode 1024x768`. By default, it will try to run in 1024x768, and if your screen's resolution is higher, you'll only see the top-left corner of the screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3. Run the game once
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. Go to the Video Settings and change the ""primary adapter"" to ""windowed"" (temporarily). Currently, the only options should be ""windowed"" and ""1024x768"".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5. Quit the game
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6. Set your primary display's resolution back to it's native res: `xrandr --output YOUR_PRIMARY_DISPLAY --auto`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7. Start the game again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8. Go back to the video settings. The ""primary adapter"" dropdown should now list all the modes available for your display. Select your native resolution (2560x1440 was listed for my display and works great). Note: when I tried keeping it on ""windowed"", the in-game hud was too small for the screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9. [optional] Set all the graphical options to max!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I recently bought the ""Supreme Commander Collection"" on Steam, which comes with SC1, SC1: Forged Alliance, and SC2. They all seemed unplayable at first, but after following these steps (essentially the same steps for each game) they run perfectly. No crashes and very performant. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TL;DR: you really only need to setup the video settings and you're good to go. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Disable Esync (if not, you'll get <1 fps in game and in menu) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Change your primary display to 1024x768 (temporarily): `xrandr --output YOUR_PRIMARY_DISPLAY --mode 1024x768`. By default, it will try to run in 1024x768, and if your screen's resolution is higher, you'll only see the top-left corner of the screen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Run the game once --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Go to the Video Settings and change the ""primary adapter"" to ""windowed"" (temporarily). Currently, the only options should be ""windowed"" and ""1024x768"". --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. Quit the game --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. Set your primary display's resolution back to it's native res: `xrandr --output YOUR_PRIMARY_DISPLAY --auto` --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. Start the game again. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. Go back to the video settings. The ""primary adapter"" dropdown should now list all the modes available for your display. Select your native resolution (2560x1440 was listed for my display and works great). Note: when I tried keeping it on ""windowed"", the in-game hud was too small for the screen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.

"I had to use winetricks to manually install DirectX 9 to make sound work. I set my Proton prefix to use Windows Vista as the WINEVER. I set the config to use an emulated desktop, and allowed it to capture the mouse. I also disabled the use of GLSL shadering, and manually specified my amount of VRAM. Next, I noticed WaW was slow. I believe it's tied to the game's config file incorrectly setting processor speed and available system RAM. The lines that read ""seta sys_configureGHz"" and ""seta sys_sysMB"" were way below my system specs. I set my processor speed to what Advanced Warfare had, in its file, 19.2.

"Framerate = Great however at times I will get 200-300 FPS then it will drop suddenly to something like 80 FPS. 


What was tested:

Singleplayer. Singleplayer did not run out the box for some reason, others have theorized that it is a DRM issue but when I downloaded a cracked iw4sp.exe it ran fine, no issues.

Multiplayer. Multiplayer worked out of the box, no complaints. Still some players playing which is nice. 


Issues:

Singleplayer did not run out the box for some reason, others have theorized that it is a DRM issue but when I downloaded a cracked iw4sp.exe it ran fine, no issues.

Framerate would be around 200-300 FPS then suddenly drop to around 80 (not sure if this is an issue but it seems odd in my opinion)

Stutters were rare but did sometimes occur, not game breaking at all.

"As kindly suggested by other users before, just set PROTON_USE_D9VK=1 %command% as a launch option (available since Proton 4.11).

I had lots of random freezes (each under the 5 seconds threshold) especially in Los Santos when aiming or moving rapidly (the frame limiter was disabled, if enabled the game was unplayable). No irreversible crash ever occurred neither graphical glitches, however. 

Still, I had to downgrade the resolution down to 720p, with quality settings set to ""high"" and frame limiter disabled: FPS were not ideal yet.

Now, using only the D9VK option, the game runs smoothly @ 1080p, with ""high"" quality settings and frame limiter disabled! (you can even enable AA 2x, however expect some stutter in heavy populated zones in Los Santos (near Emmet for example)).

"If you turn off frame limiter the game will freeze when loading cutscenes and transitions, but the game will lock at 25 fps. The only way to get higher FPS is to install Silent Patch mod which locks the game at a constant 30 fps, allows 16:9 aspect ratio, and fixes bugs. However, some features of Silent Patch will only be partially supported in the latest steam version, so downgrading the game is recommended. 
In order to downgrade GTA:SA, you would have to use this application from Rockstar Nexus, but you wont be able to connect to the Rockstar Nexus Servers to download the necessary files.  The only solution for this is to boot up windows and downgrade it there, then boot up Linux so you can transfer the files from Windows to Linux. You could try to use a VM to downgrade, but I didn't try this.

I tried to install every mod, but the game crashed when I started a new game. It worked when I just installed RemasteredGUI, SilentPatch, and Ginput. Another user also reported that 2dfx LOD mod doesn't work, so I would avoid downloading that. Some experimentation is required.

I mentioned in my last report that Manhunt had the potential of crashing when you preformed certain actions 10 seconds to a minute after preforming them.

I also forgot to add that picking up items would cause the game to freeze and crash.

However, installing this patch for Manhunt (assuming you run the Steam version: https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/540-manhunt-steam-fix/) removes all of this and makes the game fully operational. 

Just be aware that your controls hold the potential of locking up and some controls not responding. I suggest remapping all of your controls to the controls already in use or to what you want.

"I added no tweaks whatsoever to Manhunt.

The game runs well and at a silky 60fps roughly but the hair pulling part is that the game crashes 1 minute after an action or if an action isn't preformed in time.

The gates in Born Again, the first level you start on, have an even bigger chance of being permanently shut if you don't go through them in time. You'll be forced to run through and take on the hunter that's about to go through the gate, which drains a lot of your health.

Some controls need to be mapped twice in order for them to work. Do this before play.

"First one. Paused screen indefinitely on mission launch. Happens rarely, but is solved by verifying integrity of game cache on steam and launching a different normal single mission. Not Naval Academy! 
It solved it for me anyway.

Second one: A spinning screen error that's related to mouse sensitivity.  If you've messed with Transformation Matrix values in libinput or xinput to increase mouse sensitivity, then you'll have a spinning screen as soon as you capture the mouse and try to look around.

A solution:
1. Open the terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and type: xinput list
Note the ID number your mouse has. Mine has id=11, and that's what I'm using in this example. *You will have to use your own id number*

2. Type in xinput list-props <id>. 
Example: xinput list-props 11
The third row from the top is usually 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix'.  Don't worry about the decimals, unless they're something other than zeroes. The default is 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1, but yours might be different, so write them down. 

I had mine set to 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1. That increased my sensitivity to double the default value, but caused the spinning screen issues.

3. Next, type the command: 
xinput set-prop 11 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

4. Run the game and enjoy. Once you're done, run the above command and set the numbers in Coordinate Transformation Matrix back to the default.

"You can get this running easily using two different methods. You can use ""-interline"" as a launch option, or you can manually change a WINE setting so it will emulate a virtual desktop at 640x480. Using ""-interline"" as a launch option will put ugly horizontal black bars all over the screen, making the game darker and UNdebatably decreasing the picture quality. (Injecting black bars into pretty much any picture will make it look worse. There is no debate here.) The upside is you get to run the game fullscreen, and that's the only advantage to using ""-interline"". The second option, the virtual desktop method, gives better picture quality but you'll be running it in a 640x480 window. I think the virtual desktop method works better because there's a 30fps cap on Oddessy and Exoddus anyways, so that combined with the blackbars makes fullscreen look like crap. To emulate a virtual desktop, open a terminal and type ""WINEPREFIX=""/your/path/to/your/SteamApps/compatdata/15700/pfx/"" winecfg"" all one command, without the outside quotes, but keep the inside if you have any spaces in your path. For example: WINEPREFIX=""$HOME/.steam/SteamApps/compatdata/15700/pfx"" winecfg. In the new window, switch over to the graphics tab, put a checkmark in the box next to ""emulate a virtual desktop"" and change 800x600 to 640x480. Then click apply and ok, and run the game. From there, it will run perfectly. Note: If you increase the size of the virtual desktop, AbeWin.exe will automatically resize it back down to 640x480, so a larger virtual desktop won't help you. In addition to that, if you click the mouse while using a larger resolution, AbeWin.exe will crash and you will have to kill it manually. So you still need to set the virtual desktop resolution to 640x480. Outside of that, it runs perfectly. :)",147,1806,18,5.925170068027211,0.6802721088435374,get running easily using two different methods use launch option manually change wine setting emulate virtual desktop using launch option put ugly horizontal black bars screen making game darker undebatably decreasing picture quality injecting black bars pretty much picture make look worse debate upside get run game fullscreen advantage using second option virtual desktop method gives better picture quality running window think virtual desktop method works better cap oddessy exoddus anyways combined blackbars makes fullscreen look like crap emulate virtual desktop open terminal type winecfg one command without outside quotes keep inside spaces path example winecfg new window switch graphics tab put checkmark box next emulate virtual desktop change click apply ok run game run perfectly note increase size virtual desktop automatically resize back larger virtual desktop wo help addition click mouse using larger resolution crash kill manually still need set virtual desktop resolution outside runs perfectly,get run easili use two differ method use launch option manual chang wine set emul virtual desktop use launch option put ugli horizont black bar screen make game darker undebat decreas pictur qualiti inject black bar pretti much pictur make look wors debat upsid get run game fullscreen advantag use second option virtual desktop method give better pictur qualiti run window think virtual desktop method work better cap oddessi exoddu anyway combin blackbar make fullscreen look like crap emul virtual desktop open termin type winecfg one command without outsid quot keep insid space path exampl winecfg new window switch graphic tab put checkmark box next emul virtual desktop chang click appli ok run game run perfectli note increas size virtual desktop automat resiz back larger virtual desktop wo help addit click mous use larger resolut crash kill manual still need set virtual desktop resolut outsid run perfectli,get running easily using two different method use launch option manually change wine setting emulate virtual desktop using launch option put ugly horizontal black bar screen making game darker undebatably decreasing picture quality injecting black bar pretty much picture make look worse debate upside get run game fullscreen advantage using second option virtual desktop method give better picture quality running window think virtual desktop method work better cap oddessy exoddus anyways combined blackbars make fullscreen look like crap emulate virtual desktop open terminal type winecfg one command without outside quote keep inside space path example winecfg new window switch graphic tab put checkmark box next emulate virtual desktop change click apply ok run game run perfectly note increase size virtual desktop automatically resize back larger virtual desktop wo help addition click mouse using larger resolution crash kill manually still need set virtual desktop resolution outside run perfectly,60,17,29,11,[],positive,0.9262,0.111,0.069,0.82,"performance, bugs, compatibility"

"You can get this running easily but you need to manually change a WINE setting so it will emulate a virtual desktop at 640x480.

From there, it will run perfectly. Some notes: First, depending on your native resolution, this will run the game in a very small window. It's ugly but if you use a DE with a zoom feature, you can make this work. Second, if you increase the size of the virtual desktop, Exoddus.exe will automatically resize it back down to 640x480, so a larger virtual desktop won't help you. In addition to that, if you click the mouse while using a larger resolution, Exoddus.exe will crash and you will have to kill it manually.

"Videos don't play and there simply doesn't seem to be a way to make them play. From what I can tell, this could be a codec issue where Proton doesn't ship with the right codec, while all versions of windows come with it preinstalled. I've tried many solutions, including installing quartz.dll, devenum, and CCCP, and nothing works. The only solution I couldn't test, because it didn't install, was installing WMP9 via protontricks/winetricks. Presumably, installing WMP9 would have also installed the proper codecs. But this couldn't be done, as Proton seems to only use win64 prefixes and WMP9 can only be installed on a win32 prefix, as there isn't a 64 bit version of WMP9. So I'm throwing in the towel on this one. I hope someone in the future can get something useful from this information. As an interesting side note, there is an ""original"" beta branch where the problems are reversed. The videos play but the in game audio doesn't work. I haven't had any luck making it work there either. I even tried re-encoding and swapping the videos and in game ""oddio"" between the two branches and still no luck. It just refuses to work.

"Runs great after tweaks and I was able to run it in DXVK at about the same or slightly better performance than Windows 10. I did have to rename bin64 to bin32 and bin32to bin32.bak and also rename crysis64.exe to crysis.exe in the renamed bin64 file and crysis to crysis64.exe. After that, it would launch and bypass EA DRM server crap through steam itself.  Ran it at 1080p Ultra aka very high or 1440p with generally 60fps+ consistent playthrough except the demanding parts. AA did lower framerate but I used AA x2 or x4 to test the limits. Even no AA is not bad. 
I also did :$ protontricks 17300 -q d3dcompiler_43.  or $:  WINEPREFIX=/path/to/steamapps/compatdata/17300/pfx winetricks d3dcompiler_43 to do a dll override for dx10 to vk, dxvk.  Maybe you can do a dll override with it in winecfg or install d3dcompiler_43 in winetricks or protontricks GUI. 
Launch options: PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1  %command% are necessary.  You can also do -dx9 or PROTON_NO_D3D11=1 %command% if you don't want to run in dx10. Just be wary it is in OpenGL rendering so it will perform a bit worse. Vulkan at least brings performance parity to Windows running crysis in Linux. 

Same can also apply for crysis warhead.

For beginners with Ubuntu: To run the driver installation, you need to blacklist the nouveau driver (google it..), switch to runlevel 3 (sudo init 3) and install the driver as the root user.

the white tyre glitch is actually a REFLECTION, light hits it and for some reason it lights up the affected area at full tilt... (lighting bug)

these are actually VERY minor annoyances, and without any tweaks, if i had more time right now, i'd try the tweaks. got things to do for now, but i'm giving a breakdown now anyway. i'll see what happens with tweaks in a day or so and report back again...

"How To Get Red Alert 3 to Work On Linux Using Steam Proton (Graphics and Game Loading Fix)

A easy to follow guide on how to get Red Alert 3 working on Linux using Steam Proton. 

Step 1 –  Slow initial game loading.

To resolve the very slow loading (4 minutes) of the initial game, enter the following into your host file - 127.0.0.1   files.ea.com.

This can be found in Root / etc / hosts

Apparently the game tries to connect to a now defunct EA server and waits until it times out until it loads the game, so this IP Address will bypass this. 

Step 2 – Graphical Options 

By default the game will launch with a resolution of 800 x 600, so change this match your resolution.

Secondly choose your required graphic level, but make sure to disable antialiasing or you will see black articles on the screen. 

Once the steps are done, have fun playing Red Alert 3.
